Student ID: 1080915 & 1079686
Instructions:
Run the functions in order:
First import the libraries, then run
preprocess -> train -> gaussian -> predict -> evaluate
At the end, assign the datasets and then implement the functions to get the prediction accuracy
you may change the train and test file to other datasets
There is also a cell of code that allows you to get the output prediction to a csv file called "result.csv"
